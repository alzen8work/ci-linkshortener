Link Shortener Service

To do:
Build a small link shortener service with an API as well as a small web front-end with a PHP framework (eg. Laravel).

How it works:
1) The link shortener should be able to receive a URL and give back a shortened URL. When a user accesses the shortened URL he should be redirected to the full URL.

2) It should have an API endpoint where you can query statistic of a particular shortened URL and details about the users that have visited the URL with as much information as you can get on that user.

Expectation:
1) The application should be functional.

2) Commit often to the repository and make your commit messages descriptive so we can see your progress.

3) User authentication and tests are optional but welcome.

4) Please let us know how long (hours) it takes to complete the assignment.
